Getting started with Github and trying to learn my way around, Will be leaving notes for myself as well as others if it helps to move further along.
"Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Thanks to these messages, you and others can read through commits and understand what youâ€™ve done and why."
